            <p>
              My name is <strong>Daniel Tri Hendarto Tanra</strong>, and I am studying Network and Security at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia. I focus on cybersecurity and ethical hacking.
            </p>
            <p>
              I serve as <strong>Vice Head of the Education Department</strong> at PPI Malaysia and <strong>Secretary General of SEA2</strong>, where I lead educational and environmental initiatives.
            </p>
            <p>
              I was also an <strong>Election Officer</strong> with the KPU RI, helping over 300 Indonesians vote in Johor Bahru. These experiences shaped my leadership and communication skills.
            </p>
            <p>
              Creativity is a significant aspect of my identity. I've earned <strong>multiple awards</strong> in national and international competitions for video content creation, poetry, journalism, and business planning. 
              My roles as a writer, director, actor, and editor allow me to bring stories to life across various media platforms.
            </p>
            <p>
              I bring skills in Python, Java, C++, public speaking, and content production. I believe combining tech with storytelling makes communication powerful.
            </p>
            <p>
              Fluent in <strong>English, Indonesian, and Japanese</strong>, I value the power of language in fostering cross-cultural understanding. As an avid long-distance runner, I embrace discipline and perseverance, 
              qualities that permeate all areas of my life.
            </p>
            <p>
              Aside from that I inspire to explore more as a student and do a lot of cultural exchange, summer school program at other universities in europe, and eventually becoming the leader of <strong>ISS Indonesia</strong> for the next year.
            </p>
            <p>
              I believe becoming skillful at a long endevor hardship such as mastering <strong>cyber security</strong> shall not be suffice. For one must thrive for beyond and becoming a leader who can lead their communities and be inspiration for other to follow
            </p>
            <p>
              My goal is to secure <strong>digital spaces </strong> and <strong>inspire others</strong> through impactful work.
